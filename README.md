# Model-M-USB-Adapters
This respository contains the Solidworks and STL files for IBM Model M Pro Micro/Elite C adapters to make your Model M USB compatible. Original models made by [u/billybuerger on Reddit](https://www.billybuerger.com/pages/20180308_ModelMAdapter/)

I *strongly* reccommend using elite Cs if you can get your hands on one (both 1.6mm and 2.0mm should work). Pro Micros should also work but be aware that some clones do **not** have pull down resistors on the CC pins meaning that they can only be used with a C to A cable or a C to A cable with a A to C adapter on the end.
